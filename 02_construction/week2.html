    <h2>Press Fit Construction</h2>
    <p>
      I first started the press fit construction by trying to draw any shape I could think of. During
      my deliberations, I found a shape I settled on that was able to roll despite not being fully circular. 
      I found inspiration from Reuleaux triangle which can roll despite it not being fully circular. While I 
      didn't end up iterating on the shape as a whole, I did something simular and used a rectangle instead of a 
      triangle in order to create my specific shape.

      The shape as a result was the following image:

      When finalalizing details after making my sketch parametric, I had to figure out what the kerf was for my 
      shape. After I made a few copies, failing a few times to a faulty kerf, I found out it was about 0.3mm, or
      0.15mm on each side. As a result I made the width of my holes around 3.9mm in order to account for the size of
      the cardboard I was working with as well. This let me snuggly tight the shape together and I finally got the following
      image as a result.
