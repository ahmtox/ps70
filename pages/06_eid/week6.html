            <p>This weeks assignment was to make a capacitor sensor along with another sensor in some project. I explored both concepts. I first started to come up with an idea of whats the best way to create my project, in that I wanted to make use of old items I created, particularly my cup. I knew that the capacitor can detect if theres things between two modules so I decided to use that in conjucntion with a photoresistor.</p>
            <p>To give a general idea of the project is that we would have a cup, my pink cup from the week before, and put a photoresistor in the cup to detect if the cup gets covered or darker, and a capacitor to detect if items are inside the actual cup. This would act as a redudant system that would detect whatever an item was in the cup or if it was covered.</p>
            <p>Some of the materials that I needed for this was clearly a photoresistor, a breadboard, a lot of wires, 1 led and 2 100 ohms resistors.</p>
            <p>This is what the final layout looked like:</p>
            <img src="./img/layout.jpg" />
            <p>First and foremost, I had to ensure there was a valid connection that was separate for both of my capacitors and also for my photoresistor, which I was able to do separately in the digital pin section. I also an LED to view an indicator of whether the cup was covered or an item was in the cup.</p>
            <p>First I made sure that my photoresistor was well and snug in the actual cup and was able to calculate a threshold around 25 for a value in which it was the calculated resistance for my photoresistor. I used Serial plotter to keep track of this data.</p>

                <img src="./img/cupwiring.jpg" />
                <img src="./img/cupinside.jpg" />
                <img src="./img/sideview.jpg" />
                <img src="./img/photo.png" />
            </div>
            <p>After calculating the threshold from the readings, I then started to work on the capacitor, which in the same image above you can see that I calculated the threshold to be around 50000, which I would use in my code. Then I added a few if/else statements to check that the value was correct and that only when the threshold was met is when the led would display properly.</p>

            <img src="./img/fullpreview.jpg" />
            <p>I then created the code to keep track of the sensor values and then put an output to the LED.</p>
