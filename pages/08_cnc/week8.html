            <p>This weeks assignment was fairly simple. It was to desgign something and then CNC it, ideally using the ShopBot or anything else in the actual components. For my I decided to make a fidget spinner. So I went to Fusion360 and came up with a design for the actual fidget spinner. I tried to ensure there was enough sizing for a bearing side of around 1.125in.</p>

            <p>Once I had a CAD model I went to the ShopBot and made sure to select that the holes on the outside edges would only go halfway to sort of add complexity to the project.</p>

            <img src="./img/inner_view.jpg" />
            <img src="./img/outer_view.jpg" />
            <p>The project turned out fairly well. However once I put in the bearing I soon realized that from the CAD model the fidget spinner doesn't actually spin around my hand. Oops! Besides that I moved on and decided to do some vacuum forming with my actual fidget spinner. I unfortunately forgot to take a picture, but I used the vacuum former with a small blue sheet and then formet a small outline.</p>
